This software is alpha version. Use at your own risk.  

Ab (أَب), from a theoretical, abstract form (آبَاءٌ ʼabawun) (triliteral ʼ-b-w) is Arabic for "father".  

In the construct state, Abū (أبو) is followed by another word to form a complete name, e.g.: Abu Mazen, another name for Mahmoud Abbas.  

Abu may be used as a kunya, an honorific. To refer to a man by his fatherhood (of male offspring) is polite, so that ʼabū takes the function of an honorific. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_(Semitic))

## A sketchbook for quantitative analysis  

Software has become a valuable tool for mathematical modelling.  
Responsive interfaces help one to explore ideas, concepts and measurements in real time. They are widely used for several applications, from basic descriptive summaries to specialized model diagnostics.   

**Abu** aims to be:  
* Intuitive. It should intertwine *data, abstractions and representationsi* to aid **thinking**. It is intended to run *"What you see is what you get"* responsive panels for real-time manipulation. The intended experience mixes drag-and-drop elements with user input (including code). Check out [Luna Lang](https://docs.luna-lang.org/) for a more general purpose WYSIWYG software.  
* Plug and play. Spend less time on configuration and language details. A web-based interface is easy to set up and to access from anywhere. Install it on the cloud, use it in your mobile. Like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).  
* Fast. **Abu** uses **Julia** under the hood. It is one of the fastest ways to currently work while writing concise code. Its ecosystem is growing to suport tools like R [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). 
* Useful. No business-model behind this. I am a researcher building a tool *for myself and for the community*. For more on my views on science and applied mathematics, check [my book](https://github.com/fargolo/stat-learn-en).
