# Inference for Stan model: bernoulli_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(10001,10001,10001,10001); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(0,0,0,0); 40004 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00) seconds, 0.00 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00) seconds, 0.00 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using meanfield with .
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
